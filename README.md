# ExperimentalReepo
Experimenting with GH, VSC, etc. features :p

<p>
  <b>exp1_23.Mar.24</b> -> Tried uploading a photo to GH to see if I can use it (a pvt local repo) for photo backup. <b>Oh, yes! I can</b> but then I found on Google that no matter what you upload, you get a storage limit of 500MB. I was disheartened to know that. If it had unlimited storage for code files (like files having an extension .cpp, .java, etc.) then I could've just changed the extension of almost all my photo files to .cpp or anything like that to upload on GH and save on my local storage. I might be wrong in some technicalities like, the way in which things are pushed to GH might change the structure of the file that could lead to a change in the image file or even a corruption.

  <b>exp2_23.Mar.24</b> -> Also tried adding a video file and this is how I came across Git-lfs. Learned it today! Twas nice! xd!
</p>

<p>
  <b>update1_23.Mar.24</b> -> Oh, no! What the duck! I named this repository as 'ExperimentalR<b>ee</b>po' instead of 'ExperimentalRepo'. C'mon Devansh!!! So many typos and you'll end in JailHub! :p

  <b>exp3_06.Apr.24</b> -> Renaming Repos and Directos
  <p>
    So, first things first, 'directos' means 'directories', idk if this shorto would work xd! Wait, coming to the point, today I am trying to rename git repositories and trying to pull them to local git directory as well. I tweaked (ofc, the name) a repository today but couldn't pull the same to local. Since both the local and the remote were in sync, I deleted the local and re-cloned the remote. It worked! Will surely try more to get a proper way. In the way I even changed a core setting of my machine:
    
    ```
    git config core.ignorecase true
    ```
    
  </p>
</p>

<p>
  <b>update2_06.Apr.24</b> -> I am going rename this repo as well. Firstly, I am planning to use this as my GitHub and Git log report more than experimenting with features. Again, I will not stop experimenting! <b>In fact, no one should ever stop experimenting!</b> Cheers! Oh, God! For how many more days do I have to remain single!?
