# ExperimentalReepo
Experimenting with GH, VSC, etc. features :p

<p>
  <b>exp1_23.Mar.24</b> -> Tried uploading a photo to GH to see if I can use it (a pvt local repo) for photo backup. <b>Oh, yes! I can</b> but then I found on Google that no matter what you upload, you get a storage limit of 500MB. I was disheartened to know that. If it had unlimited storage for code files (like files having an extension .cpp, .java, etc.) then I could've just changed the extension of almost all my photo files to .cpp or anything like that to upload on GH and save on my local storage. I might be wrong in some technicalities like, the way in which things are pushed to GH might change the structure of the file that could lead to a change in the image file or even a corruption.

  <b>update1_23.Mar.24</b> -> Oh, no! What the duck! I named this repository as 'ExperimentalR<b>ee</b>po' instead of 'ExperimentalRepo'. C'mon Devansh!!! So many typos and you'll end in JailHub! :p
