Experimenting with GH, VSC, etc. features :p
<b>exp1_23.Mar.24</b> -> Tried uploading a photo to GH to see if I can use it (a pvt local repo) for photo backup. <b>Oh, yes! I can</b> but then I found on Google that no matter what you upload, you get a storage limit of 500MB. I was disheartened to know that. If it had unlimited storage for code files (like files having an extension .cpp, .java, etc.) then I could've just changed the extension of almost all my photo files to .cpp or anything like that to upload on GH and save on my local storage. I might be wrong in some technicalities like, the way in which things are pushed to GH might change the structure of the file that could lead to a change in the image file or even a corruption.
<b>exp2_23.Mar.23</b> -> Also tried adding a video file and this is how I came across Git-lfs. Learned it today! Twas nice! xd!
